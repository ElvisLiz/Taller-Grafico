			<h2>red sox team</h2>
			<p>The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Red Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. The Red Sox have won eight World Series championships and have played in 12. Founded in 1901 as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912. The "Red Sox" name was chosen by the team owner, John I. Taylor, around 1908, following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the "Boston Red Stockings", including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves.</p>

				<h2>jason varitek, the last captain</h2>
				<p>Jason Andrew Varitek (born April 11, 1972), nicknamed "Tek", is a retired American baseball catcher for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball. As of 2015, he works for the Red Sox as a "Special Assistant to the General Manager". After being traded as a minor league prospect by the Seattle Mariners, Varitek played his entire major league career for the Red Sox. A three-time All-Star and Gold Glove Award winner at catcher, as well as a Silver Slugger Award winner, Varitek was part of both the 2004 World Series and 2007 World Series Championship teams, and was viewed widely as one of the team's leaders. In December 2004 he was named the captain of the Red Sox, only their fourth captain since 1923.He was a switch-hitter.After Varitek's re-signing, the Red Sox appointed him to be the third team captain in franchise history, following hall of famers Carl Yastrzemski (1969–1983) and Jim Rice (1986–1989).[18] He became one of the three captains in Major League Baseball. Derek Jeter of the NY Yankees, and Paul Konerko of the Chicago White Sox were the others. He maintained his captaincy until his retirement before the 2012 season.</p>
