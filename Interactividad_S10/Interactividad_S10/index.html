I don't even like it. I just lied to
Get to your apartment, now I'm staying
Here just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired
Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?
Said they'd give you anything you ever wanted
When they lied, I knew it was just stable children
Trying hard not to realize I was sitting right behind them
Oh dear, can't you see? It's them it's not me
We're not enemies; We just disagree
If I was like them all pissed in this bar
He changes his mind, says I went too far
We all disagree
I think we should disagree, yeah
Is this it

Last night she said
Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh it turns me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turn 'round
Oh, baby, don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walkin' out that door
Well, I've been in town for just about fifteen minutes now
And baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walkin' for miles
See, people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand
Last night she said
Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turn 'round
"Oh, baby, gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night, yeah
